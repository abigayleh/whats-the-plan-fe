# PlanTogether — Claude Code Project Brief

## Feature Development Process

Before writing any code for a new feature:
1. Ask clarifying questions until you are 95% confident in the requirements
2. State your intended approach and wait for confirmation before proceeding
3. List all edge cases you've identified and confirm the handling approach with me

Do not write code until this process is complete.

---

## Code Style

### General
- Simple, readable code — optimized for skimming
- Files should be short and concise
- Comments: max 2 lines, only when non-obvious
- Less code is better

### Dependencies
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary

### Reusability
- Repeated functions → extract to a `hooks/` file and import
- Repeated components → extract to `components/` and reuse
- Never duplicate logic or JSX

### Components
- Complex components or functions → move to their own file in a dedicated folder
- Keep files focused on one responsibility

### Styling
- Minimal styles — only write CSS that overrides a non-default value
- Repeated styles → move to a global stylesheet and reuse via class names
- Prefer global styles over scoped/inline styles
- No style duplication

## Subagents

If you notice a recurring task that would benefit from a dedicated subagent (e.g. a specialized reviewer, tester, or domain-specific helper), proactively create one in `.claude/agents/`. Don't wait to be asked — if you recognize a pattern where a focused subagent would improve quality or efficiency, define it.

When creating a subagent:
- Give it a clear, narrow purpose (single responsibility)
- Use a descriptive filename matching the agent's role (e.g. `test-runner.md`, `code-reviewer.md`)
- Include a concise system prompt defining its scope, tools it should use, and when it should be invoked
- Mention the new agent to me after creating it, and explain why you thought it was needed

## Skills

If you notice a repeatable workflow, convention, or piece of domain knowledge worth capturing, proactively create or update a skill in `.claude/skills/`.

Note: skills live one-per-folder, not in a single file — `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

When creating or updating a skill:
- Give the folder a clear, descriptive name matching what it does (e.g. `.claude/skills/api-conventions/SKILL.md`)
- Start the file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) — the `description` is what determines when the skill gets auto-loaded, so make it specific about what it covers and when to use it
- Keep the SKILL.md body focused; move detailed reference material into a `references/` subfolder and reusable scripts into `scripts/` so the main file stays lean
- If a skill already exists for the topic, update it in place rather than creating a duplicate
- Mention the new/updated skill to me after saving it, and explain why you thought it was needed

## Codebase Exploration & Knowledge Sharing

Before starting non-trivial work, especially in an unfamiliar part of the codebase, explore first:

1. **Orient yourself.** Check `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/etc., directory structure, entry points, and existing tests to understand how the project is organized before editing anything.
2. **Verify, don't assume.** If existing docs (including this file) conflict with what you find in the code, trust the code and flag the discrepancy.
3. **Record what you learn.** After exploring, update this file with anything a future agent would benefit from knowing, such as:
   - Non-obvious architecture or data flow (e.g. "auth logic lives in `lib/auth/`, not `middleware/`")
   - Naming conventions or patterns that aren't self-evident
   - Gotchas, footguns, or things that look wrong but are intentional
   - Where key config, env vars, or feature flags are defined
   - Commands for build/test/lint if not already documented

### Rules for writing to this file
- **Be concise.** One or two lines per finding. This file is a map, not a diary.
- **Update, don't just append.** If a note here is outdated or wrong, fix or remove it rather than adding a contradicting note below it.
- **Only write things that generalize.** Task-specific notes belong in commit messages or PR descriptions, not here.
- **Prefer pointers over duplication.** Link to the relevant file/dir instead of copying code or explaining logic that's clear from reading the file itself.


## Project Overview

A general-purpose collaborative planning app. Users create and join named **Groups** (friend groups, roommates, trip crews, work teams — anything). Each group gets a shared calendar, lists, tasks, polls, and itineraries. Users can also chat 1-on-1 or in multi-person threads with anyone they share a group with. Everything is either private to the user, or scoped to a specific group.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React (Vite) |
| Backend | Node.js + Express + Socket.io |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Auth | JWT (access + refresh tokens) |
| ORM | Prisma |
| Styling | SASS (SCSS) |
| File Storage | Local filesystem (swap to S3 later) |
| Real-time | Socket.io |

---

## Core Concepts

### Users
- Register with username + password
- A user has their own **personal space**: private events, private lists, private tasks
- A user can belong to **multiple groups** simultaneously
- Social graph is derived from group membership — no separate friends list needed. If you share a group with someone, you can chat with them.

### Groups
- A group is a named space (e.g. "Barcelona Trip", "House 42", "Book Club")
- Created by any user; creator becomes the first admin
- Members + admins model: multiple admins allowed
- Only admins can invite, remove members, or promote/demote admins
- Invite via shareable code/link (revocable, optionally expirable)
- A user can leave a group at any time

### Visibility Model
Every piece of content (event, list, task, poll, itinerary) has a `scope`:
- `PRIVATE` — only the creator sees it
- `GROUP:{groupId}` — all members of that group see it

Implemented as two nullable columns on each model: `groupId` (FK) + a `isPrivate` boolean, or simply: if `groupId` is null, it's private.

---

## Calendar

### Multi-Group Calendar
- Sidebar shows **group toggles** (like Google Calendar) — personal + one entry per group
- User can select any combination; selected groups' events are layered and color-coded
- Default: all groups visible

### Views
- **Monthly** — event chips per day, itinerary banners spanning date ranges
- **Weekly** — columns per day, time blocks
- **Daily** — single day, time slot detail

### Events
- Title, description, start/end datetime, color label
- Scope: private or a specific group
- Optional `itineraryId` FK (child of an itinerary)
- Recurring: daily / weekly / monthly / yearly — expanded on read, not pre-materialized

### Task → Calendar Integration
- Tasks with a due date appear on calendar as chips
- 📅 Scheduled: has due date, incomplete, not overdue
- ⚠️ Overdue: due date passed, not done
- ✅ Done

---

## Lists & Tasks

### Lists
- Created by a user, scoped to: private or a specific group
- A list belongs to exactly one scope — choose on creation
- Built-in system list: **"Assigned to Me"** — read-only, auto-populated across all visible tasks

### Tasks
- Belong to a list (inherit the list's scope)
- Fields: title, description, status (todo / in-progress / done), due date (optional), assigned user (optional)
- Assigned user must be a member of the group the list belongs to (or self, if private)
- Up to 5 photos + 5 files attached per task
- Tasks with due dates surface on calendar

---

## Attachments

Shared upload infrastructure used by tasks and chat messages.

- Files saved to `/uploads/{userId}/{entityType}/{entityId}/{filename}`
- Served via `/api/files/:id`
- Max 5 photos + 5 files per task (enforced in API layer)
- To move to S3: swap write/read logic in attachment service only — schema unchanged

```prisma
model Attachment {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  filename   String
  storedPath String
  mimeType   String
  sizeBytes  Int
  uploadedBy String
  taskId     String?
  task       Task?    @relation(fields: [taskId], references: [id])
  messageId  String?
  message    Message? @relation(fields: [messageId], references: [id])
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
}
```

---

## Polls

- Any group member can create a poll scoped to that group
- Fields: question, options (1–N), optional expiry datetime
- One vote per user per poll (enforced at DB level)
- Live vote results via WebSocket

---

## Itineraries

- A named trip or outing, either **Planned** (a real date range) or **To be planned** (no dates, just `dayCount`) — never both
- Scoped to a group (or private); the scope can be changed after creation via `PATCH /api/itineraries/:id { groupId }`
- Child events link back via `Event.itineraryId`
- Calendar renders itinerary as a multi-day banner; child events appear as normal chips, color-matched

Future extensions (no schema changes needed):
- Packing list: reuse List model with an `itineraryId` FK
- Budget tracking tab

---

## Chat

### Conversation Model
A `Conversation` is the core chat primitive — it handles both DMs and group chats uniformly.

- **DM**: a conversation with exactly 2 participants (no group association)
- **Group chat**: a conversation associated with a group, with N participants (all members, or a subset)
- Conversations have a name (auto-generated for DMs: the other person's username; named for group chats)
- Users can only start a conversation with people they share at least one group with

### Messages
- Text content + optional attachments (reuses Attachment model)
- Optional `embed` JSON field for sharing a list or document: `{ type: 'list' | 'itinerary', refId: '...' }`
- Delivered in real-time via WebSocket
- `GET /api/conversations/:id/messages?before=&limit=` for paginated history on scroll

---

## WebSockets (Socket.io)

Wired from day one.

### Rooms
| Room | Who joins |
|---|---|
| `user:{userId}` | The user themselves (personal notifications) |
| `group:{groupId}` | All members of that group |
| `conversation:{conversationId}` | All participants in that chat |

### Events (server → client)
| Event | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `event:created/updated/deleted` | Calendar event mutation |
| `task:created/updated/deleted` | Task mutation |
| `list:created/updated` | List mutation |
| `poll:created` / `poll:vote` | Poll activity |
| `itinerary:created/updated` | Itinerary mutation |
| `chat:message` | New message in a conversation |
| `conversation:created` | New DM or group chat started |
| `group:member-joined/left` | Membership change |

### Auth
- Validate JWT in Socket.io middleware on `connection` — reject unauthenticated sockets before room join

## Suggested Build Order for Claude Code

1. **Project scaffold** — Vite React + Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Socket.io wired (ping/pong test)
2. **Auth** — register, login, JWT middleware, refresh token
3. **Groups core** — create, invite code, join, leave, member management, roles
4. **WebSocket rooms** — user joins `user:{id}` + `group:{id}` for each group on login
5. **Calendar backend** — event CRUD, multi-group filter, recurrence expansion; emit socket events
6. **Calendar frontend** — GroupToggleSidebar + monthly view; weekly + daily; event modal; socket invalidation
7. **Lists backend** — list + task CRUD, group scoping, assignment validation
8. **Lists frontend** — sidebar, task rows, task detail panel
9. **Attachments** — upload endpoint, file serving, AttachmentUploader component; wire to tasks
10. **Calendar × Tasks integration** — due date chips + status icons
11. **Polls** — backend + frontend + live updates via socket
12. **Itineraries** — backend + calendar banner + child event linking
13. **Conversations backend** — Conversation + Message models, DM vs group chat logic, history endpoint
14. **Chat frontend** — ConversationList, ChatWindow, real-time via socket, embed support
15. **Groups settings page** — invite management, member roles UI
16. **Push notifications scaffold** — stub Web Push + service worker; non-blocking

## Design Decisions & Notes

- **Leaving a group**: a user's created content (events, lists, tasks) in a group is orphaned — kept in DB but only visible to remaining members. The creator loses access.
- **Last admin leaving**: if the leaving user is the only remaining admin, block the leave and return a `403` with reason `LAST_ADMIN`. The frontend should detect this before the API call — on clicking "Leave Group", check if the user is the sole admin and show a warning modal: *"You're the only admin. Promote another member to admin before leaving, or leave anyway to permanently delete this group."* If they confirm deletion, call `DELETE /api/groups/:id` instead of the leave endpoint, which cascades and removes all group content. If another admin exists, leaving proceeds silently with no warning.
- **"Who can I chat with?"** — derived at runtime: fetch all users who share at least one group with the current user. No separate contacts table needed.
- **New conversation modal**: shows a people-picker filtered to shared-group members. Selecting 1 person = DM; selecting 2+ = group chat (optionally named).
- **Group calendar colors**: assign a color per group membership record (`GroupMember.color`), used consistently across calendar chips, sidebar toggles, and itinerary banners.
- **SASS structure**: use the 7-1 pattern (`abstracts/`, `base/`, `components/`, `layout/`, `pages/`, `themes/`, `vendors/`) with a single `main.scss` entry point. Define design tokens (colors, spacing, breakpoints, typography) as SCSS variables in `abstracts/_variables.scss` so they're easy to retheme later.
- **File storage swap**: change write/read logic in attachment service only — DB schema and API routes are unchanged.
- **Poll scope**: polls are always group-scoped (no private polls — doesn't make sense to poll yourself).
- **Sub-groups**: dropped for now. Can be reintroduced as member tags/labels without schema changes beyond a `Tag` join table.
